# Hack-Computer-Hardware-in-Verilog-From-NAND-to-Tetris-Verilog-Hardware-Only-
Iâ€™ve basically made an FPGA-ready implementation of the Nand2Tetris computer.  It demonstrates practical digital design skills far beyond just simulation.
This project is a Verilog-based implementation of the hardware side of the Nand2Tetris: Build a Modern Computer from First Principles course.

Instead of using the simplified HDL provided in the course, all components are written in Verilog and tested in Xilinx Vivado, making them synthesizable for FPGA deployment.

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Included

Basic logic gates (NAND, AND, OR, NOT, etc.)

Combinational circuits (Multiplexers, Adders, ALU)

Sequential circuits (Flip-flops, Counters, Registers)

Memory elements (RAM, program counter)

CPU datapath and control unit (Hack CPU â€“ hardware only)

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Not Included (Future Work)

Assembler implementation

Assembly programs or high-level software stack

Full computer integration with machine code execution

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the hardware foundation of the Hack computer in industry-standard Verilog, as a stepping stone toward a complete system.
